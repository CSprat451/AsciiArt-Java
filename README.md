# Ascii Art Project (WIP)

### Overview

This is my ascii art project that I coded in Java to help me learn the language.
This project converts an image into ascii art text and saves it as an ascii art image.

## Requirements

- Java 15
- imgscalr version 4.2 - Photo image library

## How to run the program (on Windows)

*//TO DO*

## Status

This project is a work in progress. I will be periodically updating this repository as I add more features.
Future updates will include:
- Ability to connect to React image/video upload frontend

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners by Robert Heaton.
This and additional projects are presented on www.robertheaton.com.
