# Ascii Art Project (WIP)

### Overview

This is my ascii art project that I coded in Java to help me learn the language.
This project converts an uploaded image into ascii art text, saves it as an ascii art image, 
and returns the saved image back to the frontend.

## Requirements

- Java 15
- Maven

### Technology Used In This Project

- imgscalr version 4.2 - Photo image library
- Spring Boot version 2.4.2

## How to run the program (on Windows)

In the terminal, run the following command:

`mvnw spring-boot:run
`

## Status

This project is a work in progress. I will be periodically updating this repository as I add more features.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners by Robert Heaton.
This and additional projects are presented on www.robertheaton.com.

The frontend for the image upload is located here: https://github.com/CSprat451/image-upload-frontend
